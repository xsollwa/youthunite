When you think about college, you probably picture lectures, textbooks, assignments, and exams. Yes, your academics *do* matter. But here’s the other truth: some of the most valuable parts of your college experience will happen *outside* the classroom.

By reading this course, you get to get ahead of your freshmen peers and stand out by making smart decisions. Campus involvement is a key component of building your future. Knowing people in the field of your interest often might get you further than having an A grade.

For example:

* A mentor you meet through a campus program could guide your entire career path.  
* A friend you meet at a leadership workshop might connect you to an internship.  
* A professor who knows you from a club might write you a stronger letter of recommendation than one who only saw your test scores.

College can feel huge and overwhelming, especially if you don’t know where you belong yet.  
Being part of a club, team, or organization gives you a community. It helps you make friends, feel supported, and build confidence.  
Campus involvement gets you a great resume boost, lots of LinkedIn connections, and the look “behind the scenes”, where you can see how university operates, what goes into planning a simple meeting, how do you “table at the events”, and get secured interviews.

You don’t have to leave it until “you figure it out when you get there”. You can start drafting your college experiences now!
