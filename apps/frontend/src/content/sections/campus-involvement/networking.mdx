Networking can sound intimidating, like something you only do at a career fair while dressed in a suit. But in reality, college networking is much more casual. It happens all the time through clubs, group projects, campus events, or even simple conversations with classmates and professors. Faculty networking is beneficial when you decide that you want to participate in a research study, start your own school organization, or get recommendation letters. You will need to know professors that can back you up.

What a lot of incoming freshmen do not know how to do is that they can personally introduce themselves to their professors after class. When coming up to the professor after the first lecture, you want to:

- Shake hands  
- Say your name, grade, and major.   
- If the professor mentioned something that was interesting, bring it up. A lot of professors are accomplished people with PhD and published authors. Ask if you can find out more about their work (perhaps it aligns with your career or you are genuinely just interested in their work).   
- Say that you look forward to their classes!

On your first day, professors will share their office hours that you can utilize as well. Stopping by for a chat regarding your class or a question you had makes you known to them. Out of hundreds of students that they teach every day, be the one they remember!   

Alumni networking also applies when you want to attend alumni events, such as alumni fairs or panels. They might even invite you to shadow at their workplace! Make sure that you connect with graduating students on LinkedIn or even reach out to them personally. If you like their position that they hold or a company they work at, you can always email them with questions. It never hurts to ask!
