When you apply to become a member of any school organization, there is a 95% chance that you will be asked to fill out an application prior to having an interview. This is your first challenge in order to stand out from the hundreds of other applicants by having a fully filled out, rich application. Take a look and compare these **real applications** from incoming freshmen:

*Example 1*  
Question: How do you spend your time outside of your role as a student?

| Applicant 1 | Applicant 2 |
| :---- | :---- |
| Outside of classes, I stay pretty involved on campus. I work as a *X* Assistant and a *X* Assistant helping students, faculty and staff with everything from finding resources to solving tech issues. I really enjoy these roles because they let me meet people from all over campus and learn new things every day. I’m also part of the *X* Mentorship Program, where I get to support other students as they adjust to university life. Volunteering has always been important to me, so I try to stay connected with causes I care about, especially in education, cultural exchange and sustainability. When I have free time, I love learning languages, reading and going to campus events. These hobbies help me connect with different cultures and make *UniversityName* feel even more like home. | working, student orgs, networking |

What do you notice?  
When answering even the most basic question, **do not** be lazy. **Always be specific and detailed!**  
Talk about your hobby and what you can tie it to. Explain what you did in high school, show the way your hobby can impact others. Do you like cooking? Elaborate on how you cook for others or teach to cook someone else (even if they are your siblings). Do you work or had a job before? Talk about what you did and what skills it gave you! Do you just like to hang out with friends? Talk about where you like to go in your free time! 

*Example 2*  
Question: What are your goals for this academic year?

| Applicant 1 | Applicant 2 | Applicant 3 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Create new learning habits to help me be the best I can be in college. | To get a handle of this new chapter in my life. | My goals for the \[...\] school year are to get involved within organizations that make me feel fulfilled, and become exactly who I want to be. In high school I spent many hours within clubs \[...\] providing service to my school. I absolutely loved doing this and it made me feel as though I had an important role. Arriving at college as a freshman has felt quite different from my position in high school, but \[...\]. I also love the idea of having a chance to be a positive person \[...\] and learning more about myself than ever before. |

When the question itself might get blurry because you might not have definite goals yet, you can always self-reflect from what you initially feel. If you are creating new learning habits, share what they are. Is it minimizing distractions? Or spacing out your studying? Taking practice tests? Creating flashcards? Tell more! Recruiters at your school organization will want to hear about it. 

*Example 3*   
Question: Is there anything else you would like us to know?

| Applicant 1 | Applicant 2 | Applicant 3 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Thanks for reading this if you did, go have a dessert or treat before bed tonight. | N/A | I hope to join this organization to give back to the college that I have tried to immerse myself into already and I look forward to hearing back. |

This last question is more important than what it seems! **Treat it like a trick question that you want to answer.** A simple “looking forward to hearing back” sets you further than your peers who do not want to answer. Feel free to use this question as an opportunity to tell a fun fact about yourself, something that is unique about you, or put more information about your experiences that you couldn’t share in previous questions. While this question is there for you to add extra strength to your candidacy, you should still stay professional. The response from Applicant 1 is an example of when the response might come off as unprofessional and dismissive. **Do not waste your opportunity to stand out in a meaningful way!**
