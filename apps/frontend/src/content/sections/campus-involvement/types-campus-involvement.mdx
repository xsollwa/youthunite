Every club or school organization at your school will have either a website or social media for you to reach out to. It is important to understand where exactly you want to find yourself and what works best for you. Usually, every school has:

* **School organizations**: structured and formal groups that are often tied to academics, leadership, and/or professional development. These organizations almost always will have an E-board (executive board) with annual elections for you to apply and secure a leadership role. They might give out additional scholarships that are exclusive only to members. Meetings are often required to attend.    
  ***Examples***: Undergraduate Student Government, Black Student Union, Nursing Association, etc.  
* **School clubs**: less formal, student-led, centered around hobbies and interests. Depending on a school club, it might also offer you extra opportunities, offer trips as a group, etc. Meetings are often Examples: Chess Club, Dance Club, Anime club, etc.  
* **Service and Volunteering**: a chance for you to give back through different means. You can always choose when to volunteer, unless there is a specific organization that might be in your school based on philanthropy and community service.   
  ***Examples***: volunteering at a food pantry or community garden, tutoring (note: sometimes can be monetarily rewarded), participating in campus-wide events that require staff to set up/clean up.   
* **Recreation and wellness**: sports are always offered at schools to stay active and involved. They usually have try-ins before or during the first week of school, so you might want to keep an eye out for the dates.   
  ***Examples***: Volleyball Club, Football Club, Swimming Club, Yoga/Pilates Class, etc.  
* **Academic and Professional Development**: you can get involved with organizations that are meant for networking and connecting you to your studies and future career. They might have interviews and applications that have strict deadlines before or during the first month of school.   
  ***Examples***: Honor societies, research study with a professor, professional student associations (Pre-Law Society, Business Fraternities, Future Educators). 

Any school club or organization that you find interesting will always have a tabling event to welcome you on campus! Do not hesitate to contact them because they want you as much as you want them! At the tabling event, school organizations often give out freebies and collect contact information to reach out to you after the welcoming events. Do not be afraid to ask questions and stand out. Sign up for the unofficial meetings for a casual chat and follow them on social media.

Even though you would want to get involved, **be mindful of your class schedule**! Having a part-time job, 18 credits, and 4 clubs on your hands will, unfortunately, set you back. You might burn out, overbook yourself, and get bad grades because there is physically not enough time to do it all. Choose wisely and plan to get more involved in the future when you can better understand your balance and limits.
