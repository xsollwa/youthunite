If you’ve been selected for an interview, it is a big step forward! That means that you got chosen from the pool of applicants and you are the one they want to learn about more. Lock in! Know what you should do in order to nail your interview and be their ultimate choice.   

**Tip 1: Research an organization.**  
Know the values and mission statement, find a value that deeply resonates with you, and talk about how their school organization perfectly aligns with your vision. It is always a good idea to do a “background check”, where you have some knowledge about the work they do, history behind the organization, events that they participate in or host.   

**Tip 2: Bring a notebook and a pen.**  
While it is not necessary to bring something with you, you want to stand out. A little notebook with written questions for you to ask them goes a long way! It will also come in handy when you will have to write some important information down, such as dates or names that come up in the conversation. Nothing bad will happen if you write it in your notes app on the phone or ask for a sticky note, but if you want to stand out, this is the way!   

**Tip 3: Always ask questions!**  
Remember that you are interviewing them as much as they interview you. Do not be afraid to ask to elaborate on something you didn’t quite understand or want elaboration on. Interviewers would much prefer to see your sincere interest and engagement rather than nodding for 30 minutes.   

**Tip 4: Be prepared for common questions.**  
The most basic questions are the most important: why do you want to join? What skills and experiences can you bring? What are your strengths and weaknesses? Try to be prepared ahead and think of your responses beforehand.   

**Tip 5: Be professional**  
For your interview, you want to look neat. Shake hands when you first meet, make eye contact, smile, and express genuine interest in the role!
