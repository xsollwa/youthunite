Getting involved on campus also means knowing what support systems exist to help you succeed. Many students don’t realize how many offices and services are available until they’re struggling.  
Though it is likely that you will be given a pamphlet with all the information during your
orientation day, you still want to go over the available resources and know where you can get help.
These support systems can also offer job positions and leadership opportunities, such as
internships, that count as campus involvement as well!

Campus resources vary by university but these support systems should be common:

* Student life / Student Activities Office: usually hub for clubs, events, and leadership training.  
* Career service: resume help, mock interviews, internship/job postings, professional headshots  
* Advising Centers: academic planning, major/minor exploration, schedule building  
* Counseling & Wellness Center: mental health support, workshops  
* Tutoring & Writing Centers: free academic help  
* Recreation Center: gym, fitness, pool, etc. 

  And many others!
