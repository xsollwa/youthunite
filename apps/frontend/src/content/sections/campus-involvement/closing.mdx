As we finish up, remember one thing: involvement on campus isn’t about checking off boxes or making your resume look good. It’s about finding your people, building real connections, and making college feel like more than just lectures and assignments. You will have plenty of time to get involved, build lifelong friendships and useful, genuine connections. Take your time and have fun!
